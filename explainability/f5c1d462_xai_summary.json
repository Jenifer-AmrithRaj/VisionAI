This indicates a very low current risk of diabetic eye disease.\n\nRecommendations:\n- Continue routine annual retinal screening.\n- Maintain good blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol control.\n- Seek medical attention if you notice visual symptoms such as blur, floaters, or flashes.\n\nConfidence Level: 84.32%\nEstimated Risk: Minimal\n\nVisionAI provides decision-support only and does not replace clinical examination.",

Explainability analysis and lesion quantification were intentionally skipped due to absence of pathological findings.\n\nRecommendation:\nRoutine annual screening is advised unless additional clinical risk factors exist.\n\nModel Confidence: 84.32%",
