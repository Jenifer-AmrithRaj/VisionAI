It’s important to meet your eye doctor soon.\n\nDetected stage: Severe diabetic retinopathy.\n\nFindings summary: exudates 16.9%, hemorrhages 7.6%, cotton wool 0.0%, lesion percentage 7.7%.\nModel confidence: N/A.\nRisk factors noted: smoking, high blood pressure, obesity (BMI ≥ 30).\n\nNext steps: Book an ophthalmology appointment as soon as possible for further evaluation.\n\nRemember — early attention helps preserve your vision. 💙",
